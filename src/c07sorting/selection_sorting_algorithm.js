/* . Write a C program to sort a list of elements using the selection sort algorithm. >
According to Wikipedia "In computer science, selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O(n2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort".
    Note :
a) To find maximum of elements
b) To swap two elements */
